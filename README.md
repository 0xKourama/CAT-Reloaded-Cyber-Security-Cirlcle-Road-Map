▶ How to be a member of CAT Reloaded?

📌 Almost every year we host a recruitment [Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/375956410319681/?active_tab=discussion "Event") in Mansoura University to attract all of the interested students in Computer Science in general, categorizing them in Circles meant for different fields, of course there is a Cyber Security Circle.

------------

## before start you should know:

▶  So what is“Cyber Security”?

📌 It is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide
 enriched your mind with these talks from [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/playlists/10/who_are_the_hackers "TEDx") about cybersecurity and hackers.

------------

▶ What do we need to start?

📌 To start you should build your land hard so we have some basics you should      know at first to be ready to start your study in cybersecurity. These basics will be in our entry level.

> You do not need any requirements to start, you only need **Passion**, **Power** and **Persistence**

------------

▶ What is a good resource to study ?

📌 You should know that the Cyber Security path is not easy or clear and it takes time, there is no clear path to you or path from 0 to hero.

📌 We make an effort to make our paths in this field or in our life to make it easier from other mentors, good resources, study smart and be in touch with new technologies. This is a way to learn, this field is different from other fields.

📌 you should study everytime if you are beginner or expert you will not reach the top because this track is increasing rapidly you can't imagine that it has a lot of branches like Pentesting, Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics and a lot of them and a lot of jobs in this career to ensure of that please watch this video.

# ENTRY LEVEL


▶ Entry level will **not** make you professionals or have a high level in this topic.
	Firstly you need to know if your **passion** is true or false, right or wrong for cyber security to measure your **loving** and **capability** in this field

You should take an overview in:
📌 1. Operating System **(LINUX)**
📌 2. Programming language **(PYTHON) **
📌 3. **Networking **

▶ After that you should know what you will study Pentesting or Reverse or Networking 

▶ **Notes:**

📌 1. At the end of this level, a member can decide if he joined the right circle for him or not.

📌 2. Please note that the links and courses below are my recommended but may not be the best for everyone, so if you struggle during one of these, you should seek something 		else.

📌 3. Every 2 weeks there’s a seminar with the leader of the branch to discuss what’s next and what has been achieved so far.

------------

## before start you should know:

‚ñ∂  So what is‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù?

üìå It is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide
 enriched your mind with these talks from [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/playlists/10/who_are_the_hackers "TEDx") about cybersecurity and hackers.

------------

‚ñ∂ What do we need to start?

üìå To start you should build your land hard so we have some basics you should      know at first to be ready to start your study in cybersecurity. These basics will be in our entry level.

> You do not need any requirements to start, you only need **Passion**, **Power** and **Persistence**

------------

‚ñ∂ What is a good resource to study ?

üìå You should know that the Cyber Security path is not easy or clear and it takes time, there is no clear path to you or path from 0 to hero.

üìå We make an effort to make our paths in this field or in our life to make it easier from other mentors, good resources, study smart and be in touch with new technologies. This is a way to learn, this field is different from other fields.

üìå you should study everytime if you are beginner or expert you will not reach the top because this track is increasing rapidly you can't imagine that it has a lot of branches like Pentesting, Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics and a lot of them and a lot of jobs in this career to ensure of that please watch this video.

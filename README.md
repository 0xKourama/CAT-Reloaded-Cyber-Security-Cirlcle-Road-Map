   In the beginning; I must mention [Nidal Fikri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nidal-fikri-776403125/ "Nidal Fikri") who brought the Circle back to work and we learned a lot from him.
This year, I'm the Leader of the Circle going to put our Mentors vision on this road map

📌 Almost every year we host a recruitment [Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/375956410319681/?active_tab=discussion "Event") in Mansoura University to attract all of the interested students in Computer Science in general, categorizing them in Circles meant for different fields, of course there is a Cyber Security Circle.

![CAT Logo](img/m.jpg)
------------

## before start you should know:

▶  So what is“Cyber Security”?

📌 It is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide
 enriched your mind with these talks from [TEDx](https://www.ted.com/playlists/10/who_are_the_hackers "TEDx") about cybersecurity and hackers.

------------

▶ What do we need to start?

📌 To start you should build your land hard so we have some basics you should      know at first to be ready to start your study in cybersecurity. These basics will be in our entry level.

> You do not need any requirements to start, you only need **Passion**, **Power** and **Persistence**

------------

▶ What is a good resource to study ?

📌 You should know that the Cyber Security path is not easy or clear and it takes time, there is no clear path to you or path from 0 to hero.

📌 We make an effort to make our paths in this field or in our life to make it easier from other mentors, good resources, study smart and be in touch with new technologies. This is a way to learn, this field is different from other fields.

📌 you should study everytime if you are beginner or expert you will not reach the top because this track is increasing rapidly you can't imagine that it has a lot of branches like Pentesting, Reverse Engineering, Digital Forensics and a lot of them and a lot of jobs in this career to ensure of that please watch this [video](https://youtu.be/2TofunAI6fU "video").

------------

▶ What are our branches in Circle?

# ENTRY LEVEL

![CAT Logo](img/circle.png)

▶ Entry level will **not** make you professionals or have a high level in this topic.
	Firstly you need to know if your **passion** is true or false, right or wrong for cyber security to measure your **loving** and **capability** in this field

You should take an overview in:

📌 1. Operating System **(LINUX)**

![CAT Logo](img/linux.png)

[why to use Linux ?](https://blog.catreloaded.org/2020/09/why-to-use-linux/)

📌 2. Programming language **(PYTHON)**

![CAT Logo](img/python.png)

[why to Learn Python ?](https://blog.catreloaded.org/2020/07/python-for-cyber-security/)

📌 3. **Networking**

▶ After that you should know what you will study **Pentesting** or **Reverse** or **Networking** 

▶ **Notes:**

🔴 1. At the end of this level, a member can decide if he joined the right circle for him or not.

🔴 2. Please note that the links and courses below are my recommended but may not be the best for everyone, so if you struggle during one of these, you should seek something 		else.

🔴 3. Every 2 weeks there’s a seminar with the leader of the branch to discuss what’s next and what has been achieved so far.

#### ▶ [Plan Time-Line](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tkTilM82PxNjtr7IDOhXhEBIVVQD5KGvTk_J55lYeyI/edit?usp=sharing "Plan Time-Line")

# kickoff

📌 1. **Before we begin in this level you should know something called:**
	
**-  “Learning  difficulties”:**

🔴 How you study books and references, you must know that many difficulties will confront you with everything you learn, so you should not be bored or unable to do what you must do.

🔴 You must know that you will stop a lot and you will not understand too much, but you must return and resist

**🔴 You must write and practice for everything you learn so that you do not get lost from you, either in your hand or in a text file on your personal computer. Massive practice .**

📌 2. This stage is for those **who will pass the Entry Level.**

📌 3. Before you start, you must Choose your **path** from the 3 **branches**.

📌 5. This is the **longest** and most **important** level in the circle’s technical road map. It may take more than a year but it is really worth it. A circle member with this knowledge will be fully ready to have **internships** and begin the professional advanced study phase.

📌 6. It’s **recommended** to study the materials in the **order** mentioned below.

![CAT Logo](img/nw.png)


📌 1. **[CCNA course by Jeremy Cioara](https://www.1377x.to/torrent/112935/CBT-Nuggets-Cisco-CCNA-Certification-Package/ "CCNA course by Jeremy Cioara")** (well first thing is first we need to understand the basic protocols and concepts of network and this course is the main method to achieve this target).

📌 2. **[CCNA-security course by CBt nuggets](https://www.1377x.to/torrent/1380636/CBT-Nuggets-Cisco-CCNA-Security-210-260-IINS/ "CCNA-security course by CBt nuggets")** (this course is the real deal when it comes to network security fundamentals as it  illustrates so many basic technologies and concepts).

📌 3. **[Vmware course](https://www.1377x.to/torrent/3894485/CBT-Nuggets-VMware-NSX-Introduction-and-Installation-FCO/ "Vmware course")** We will walk ourselves together in the virtual machines world through the intermediate level period in the VMware workstation but if you have any intention in taking this as a real challenge you could check this course as well Vmware course.

📌 4. **routeHub - FortiGate 6.0 Firewall Training** (this course dives in the firewall technology as it walks us through the fortigate firewall which is one of the most used products in the industry 
Although it’s a slightly older version but there’s no huge differences in the new version  

**Notes:**

🔴 All of these courses are in English with English subtitles .. if you struggled with it in the beginning please don’t give up. It's highly recommended that you continue gradually because there’s no equivalent quality in Vmware course .. And if it's necessary you can check this **[Arabic](https://www.youtube.com/user/abeerhosni "Arabic")** channel.
We have downloaded all of these courses for you so if you need any of this data offline kindly inform the circle leader before any of the sessions or meetings.

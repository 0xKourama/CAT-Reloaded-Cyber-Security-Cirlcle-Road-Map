 ENTRY LEVEL:

“ Entry level will not make you professionals or have a high level in this topics    firstly you need to know if your passion is true or false, right or wrong for cyber security to measure your loving and capability in this field so you should take an overview in Operating System, Programming language (Python) and Networking for everyone in the circle, after that you should know what you will study Web or Reverse or Networking ”

Note: 
At the end of this level, a member can decide if he joined the right circle for him or not.

Please note that the links and courses below are my recommended but may not be the best for everyone, so if you struggle during one of these, you should seek something else.

Every 2 weeks there’s a seminar with the leader of the branch to discuss what’s next and what has been achieved so far.

------------------------------------------------------------------

INTERMEDIATE LEVEL :

Before we begin in this level you should know something called
-  “Learning  difficulties”:

How you study books and references, you must know that many difficulties will confront you with everything you learn, so you should not be bored or unable to do what you must do.
You must know that you will stop a lot and you will not understand too 
much, but you must return and resist

You must write everything you learn so that you do not get lost from you, either in your hand or in a text file on your personal computer. Massive practice .

This stage is for those who will pass the entry level.

Before you start, you must Choose your path from the 3 branches.

Please note that the links and courses below are my recommended but may not be  the best for everyone, so if you struggle during one of these, you should seek something else.

This is the longest and most important level in the circle’s technical road map. It may take the whole year but it is really worth it, a circle member with this knowledge will be fully ready to have internships and begin the professional advanced study phase.

It’s recommended to study the materials in the order mentioned below.

Network Security Path (defensive):

CCNA course by Jeremy Cioara (well first thing is first we need to understand the basic protocols and concepts of network and this course is the main method to achieve this target).
	
CCNA-security course by CBt nuggets (this course is the real deal when it comes to network security fundamentals as it  illustrates so many basic technologies and concepts).

We will walk ourselves together in the virtual machines world through the intermediate level period in the VMware workstation but if you have any intention in taking this as a real challenge you could check this course as well Vmware course.
routeHub - FortiGate 6.0 Firewall Training (this course dives in the firewall technology as it walks us through the fortigate firewall which is one of the most used products in the industry 
Although it’s a slightly older version but there’s no huge differences in the new version  



 
Notes: 
All of these courses are in English with English subtitles .. if you struggled with it in the beginning please don’t give up. It's highly recommended that you continue gradually because there’s no equivalent quality in Arabic .. And if it's necessary you can check this Arabic channel.
We have downloaded all of these courses for you so if you need any of this data offline kindly inform the circle leader before any of the sessions or meetings.
